I am a **mechatronics** engineer with a Masters in **control engineering** and **robotics**. I am also _that_ guy obssesed with airplanes and basically everything that flies.

### My interests

I enjoy working with robotics, software, and control engineering in general. Specifically, I have been working on designing flight controllers for autonomous flying vehicles. I have developed an adaptive sliding mode control strategy based on visual cues, which you can find the simulation videos in the following links: 

- [Adaptive sliding mode control for a QUAV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMEtGg45hEI)
- [Adaptive visual sliding mode control using quaternions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GprqokqhALo)

These videos are part of my research, which you can find in my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=43WNdgkAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I also enjoy working with Machine Learning and software development, which has allowed me to publish other scientific papers, also available on my Google Scholar.

### How did I even get here?

During my bachelor's, I thought control engineering was extremely boring. It wasn't until I programmed a PID using LabVIEW that I thought to myself: *Wait a minute... this applies to many areas in engineering.* And so I became engaged by the incredible world of system theory, controllers, and optimization problems. The journey 
has been that impactful for my life because I became interested in more mathematical stuff, mainly linear algebra. I really feel this allowed me to be in contact with the idea that the more you research something, the more you understand how many things you weren't even aware of. _Beautiful._

### What do I do nowadays?

I am working as a **research associate** at the University of Paderborn. I am the current tutor of **system theory** and **advanced system theory** courses. Teaching these topics has been an introspective experience too. Additionally, I am working to produce a comprehensive guide regarding the current status of **direct data-driven Model Predictive Control** as well as reproducing example algorithms from authors like Dr. Jeremy Coulson and Dr. Julian Berberich.
