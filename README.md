I am a **mechatronics** engineer with a Masters in **control engineering** and **robotics** that loves airplanes and basically everything that flies.

### How did I even get here?

During my bachelors I thought control engineering was extremely boring, and it wasn't until I programmed a PID using LabVIEW that I thought to myself: wait a minute... this is... applicable to many areas in engineering. And so I became engaged by the incredible world of system theory, controllers and optimization problems. 

### What do I do nowadays?

I am working as a **research associate** at the University of Paderborn. I am the current tutor of **system theory** and **advanced system theory** courses. Teaching these topics was been an introspective experience too. Additionally I have been producing a comprehensive guide regarding the current status of **direct data-driven Model Predictive Control**. 

### Professional interest

I enjoy working designing flight controllers for autonomous flying vehicles. I have developed an adaptive sliding mode control strategy based on visual cues that you can find the simulation videos in the following links:
